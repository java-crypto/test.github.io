Generate a secure random AES key
---------------

One of the most important fact for secure cryptography is to use an encryption key that is generated randomly and **not** by taking a passwordphrase and simply convert it to a key.

The codes will generate an AES key with size of 32 byte = 256 bit that is the maximum key size available for AES encryption.

**This is a serious warning regarding the security of the programs shown in these article series.  Always keep in mind my disclaimer regarding my programs: All programs are for educational purposes and are not intended to use in production or any other programs where a  secure solution is needed. The programs do not have proper exceptional/error handling and in some cases they use insecure key lengths or other methods that are insecure. Never ever use the programs in real life without they are checked by a qualified professional cryptographer.**

The following links provide the solution in code and within an online compile that runs the code.

This is an output (as there is a random element your output will differ):
